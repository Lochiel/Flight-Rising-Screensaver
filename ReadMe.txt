Flight Rising Screensaver for the Roku

This will show dragons from your lair on your Roku.

This makes a minimal amount of calls to the Flight rising servers. It calls the Lair page, and the Image URL that is published by Flight Rising for use in forum posts, Tumblr posts, reddit, etc. etc.

To compile, exclude the .pkg file, the Non-Pkg Images folder, and this ReadMe, and replace the Program.zip

Once you've loaded it to your Roku, use the Screensaver config pages to set your UserID and you are ready to go.
